TODO:
	Alignment:
		✓ Translate all shapes to centroid at (0,0)
		✓ Calculate mean shape
		✓ Procrustes align all shapes to mean shape
		✓ Calculate new mean shape
		✓ Realign all shapes to new mean shape

	PCA:
		✓ Do PCA on all aligned shapes
		- Find significant amount of eigenvectors to describe head movement and head shape variance, but not expression

	Warp:
		- Find transformation that best fits mean shape by varying first PCA components
		- Warp images to transformed shape
			- Make Delaunay triangulation of shape
			- Make new triangulation of of new shape
			- Extract convex hull of shape
			- for each triangle
				- for each pixel in triangle 
					- Determine barycentric coordinate (affine tran)s
					- Determine Cartesian coordinate in new triangulation
					- Round coordinate of to nearest pixel position (MATLAB: griddata?!)
					% - Add pixel value to new pixel position
					% - Add 1 to new position pixel counter
			% - Element-wise divide pixel values with pixel counter 
				(Average overlapping pixels)
