TODO:
	Alignment:
		Translate all shapes to centroid at (0,0)
		Calculate mean shape
		Procrustes align all shapes to mean shape
		Calculate new mean shape
		Realign all shapes to new mean shape

	PCA:
		Do PCA on all aligned shapes
		Find significant amount of eigenvectors to describe head movement and head shape variance, but not expression

	Warp:
		Find transformation that best fits mean shape by varying first PCA components
		Warp images to transformed shape
			Make Delaunay triangulation of shape
			Extract convex hull of shape
			for each triangle
				Map pixels from original image in PCA transformed shape to the mean shape
