	\label{sec:conclusion}
	In this project I attempted to reproduce the results of \cite{Lucey2011} and succeeded to some degree. 
	The were however some significant shortcomings, the reasons for which was discussed in Section \ref{sub:discussion}.

	I also attempted to implement a pain recognition system for facial images using a deep Convolutional Neural Network.
	I did not succeed in creating a working proof-of-concept within the time available for this project.
	Still, I was able to present \emph{some} results.

	I do believe that I made some valuable progress, towards reaching the goal of implementing a CNN for pain recognition, that others can build upon after me.

	All in all the outcome of this project has been mostly educational, albeit somewhat disappointing, for the author.
	Hopefully others may draw experience from this, and use it to improve on the results herein.
