\section{Normalized Appearance and Shape Method Using SVM} % (fold)
	\label{sec:normalized_appearance_and_shape_method_using_svm}
	In this section I describe how I tried to reproduce the results of \cite{Lucey2011} by implementing my own algorithm for extracting data and training a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) using LIBSVM \cite{CC01a}.

	The data extracted from the database and used in the experiments are normalized shape and shape normalized appearance (described in greater detail in Section \ref{sub:data_pre_processing_and_feature_extraction} below).
	Two experiments will be done with these data.
	One will focus on detecting the presence of FACS Action Units relevant to PSPI model described in Section \ref{ssub:pain_score}.
	The other will focus only on the detection of pain.
	Both will experiments will tested using the shape data alone and with shape and appearance data combined.

		\subsubsection{Shape Data} % (fold)
			\label{ssub:shape_data}
			The raw shape data consists of \texttt{.txt}-file for each frame with two columns of (x,y) pixel coordinates, 66 points in total each for a specific facial landmark.
			\fxnote{insert image of facial landmarks, possibly numbered} 
			These combined make a mask of the facial shape.
			They are however centered in the corner of the image and shifted, scaled and rotated arbitrarily form subject to subject and from frame to frame because of movement.

			\paragraph{Procrustes Alignment} % (fold)
				\label{par:procrustes_alignment}
				In order to use the shape data they need to be shifted to a zero mean reference and be normalized with regard to size and rotation, without affecting shape.
				For this, Procrustes alignment is just what is needed.
