@article{Sarasvathy2001,
abstract = {In economics and management theories, scholars have traditionally assumed the existence of artifacts such as firms/organizations and markets. I argue that an expla- nation for the creation of such artifacts requires the notion of effectuation. Causation rests on a logic of prediction, effectuation on the logic of control. I illustrate effectu- ation through business examples and realistic thought experiments, examine its connections with existing theories and empirical evidence, and offer a list oi testable propositions for future empirical work.},

@article{Shane2000,
abstract = {To date, the phenomenon of entrepreneurship has lacked a conceptual framework. In this note we draw upon previous research conducted in the different social science disciplines and applied fields of business to create a conceptual framework for the field. With this framework we explain a set of empirical phenomena and predict a set of outcomes not explained or predicted by conceptual frameworks already in existence in other fields.},
